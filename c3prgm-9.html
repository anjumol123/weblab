   <p>A star is an astronomical object comprising a luminous spheroid of plasma held together by self-gravity.<br> 
   The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye at night; their immense distances from Earth make them appear as fixed points of light.<br>
   The most prominent stars have been categorised into constellations and asterisms, and many of the brightest stars have proper names </p>
